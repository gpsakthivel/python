EXERCISE: If statements

Let's practice your if statements.

Suppose we are checking tires of all the cars in our street. We want an if statement that checks the tyre pressure and rates it 'good', 'medium', or 'bad'.

Create a variable called pressure

Create an if statement that says

If pressure is less than or equal to 20 then print 'bad'

If pressure is greater than 20 and less than or equal to 30 then print 'medium'

if pressure is greater than 30 then print 'good'

Play around with setting your pressure variable to different values to make sure your script works as intended.

You can see my answer in the following article.

# Solution:
pressure = 20
 
if pressure <= 20:
    print('bad')
elif pressure >20 and pressure <=30:
    print('medium')
elif pressure >30:
    print('good')
